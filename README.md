# ğŸš€ Today's New Learning: Django Framework!

I explored the powerful Django framework today and took my first steps into web development with it. Here's what I accomplished:

âœ… Created a new project  
âœ… Built my first app  
âœ… Set up an admin user for easy management  

### Commands I used:
ğŸ”¹ **Create Project**: `django-admin startproject <projectname>`  
ğŸ”¹ **Create App**: `python manage.py startapp <appname>`  
ğŸ”¹ **Create Admin User**: `python manage.py createsuperuser`  
ğŸ”¹ **Run the Server**: `python manage.py runserver`

Excited to dive deeper into Django and learn more about this amazing framework! ğŸŒŸ
