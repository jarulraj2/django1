ğŸš€ Today's New Learning: Django Framework!

I explored the powerful Django framework today and took my first steps into web development with it. Here's what I accomplished:

âœ… Created a new project

âœ… Built my first app

âœ… Set up an admin user for easy management


Commands I used:

ğŸ”¹ Create Project: django-admin startproject <projectname>

ğŸ”¹ Create App: python manage.py startapp <appname>

ğŸ”¹ Create Admin User: python manage.py createsuperuser

ğŸ”¹ Run the Server: python manage.py runserver
